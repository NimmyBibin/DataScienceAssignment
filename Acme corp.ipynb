    "The Company by the name Acme Corporation manufactures light bulbs. The CEO of the company claims that an average Acme light bulb lasts for 300 days. So for testing, 15 bulbs are selected by a researcher randomly. An average sample bulb lasts for 290 days, with 50 days of standard deviation. What is the probability that 15 randomly selected bulbs do not have an average life of more than 290 days?"
